PM Wrapper Note: Granular Reconciliation of Token Transfers

Being able to decode ERC-20 transfer details from both the transaction input data and the on-chain event logs is critical for granular reconciliation of tokenized assets. The input data represents the requested action, while the event log represents the confirmed, executed outcome, and comparing the two provides a direct, evidence-based check that a transfer happened exactly as intended.

This technical capability enables precise tracking of asset movements at the individual transaction level, which is essential for identifying discrepancies and ensuring data integrity during migrations or operational audits. For a Digital Asset Reconciliation and Migration Lead, this kind of dual-source validation is exactly the same control pattern used in traditional reconciliation between a purchase order and a delivery receipt, just applied on-chain.

Ultimately, this provides irrefutable proof of transfer: a timestamped, cryptographically verifiable record that the requested value and the executed value match, which is the foundation for trust during any hybrid or full migration to tokenized rails.
